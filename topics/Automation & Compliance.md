# Cloud Security Automation & Compliance

## 1. Foundations of Compliance in the Cloud

Compliance ensures cloud systems meet **external regulations** and **internal policies**.

Frameworks define **security controls** to validate and prove adherence.

### Key Frameworks:
- **NIST 800-53** – Security control catalog.
- **SOC 2** – Trust Services Criteria (security, availability, confidentiality, privacy, processing integrity).
- **ISO 27001** – Global standard for information security.
- **DORA** – EU regulation for financial sector resilience.
- **Shared Responsibility Model** – Clarifies cloud provider vs. customer responsibilities.

### Compliance Goals:
- Meet legal and regulatory requirements.
- Reduce organizational risk.
- Build trust with customers and stakeholders.


## 2. Mapping Security Controls to Compliance

Translate technical implementations into compliance evidence.

| Control | NIST | SOC 2 | CIS Benchmark |
|---------|------|-------|---------------|
| IAM | AC-2 | CC6.1 | — |
| Logging | AU-6 | CC7.2 | — |
| Encryption | SC-13 | — | 3.11 |

### Examples:
- **AWS Config Conformance Packs** enforcing CIS benchmarks.
- **SOC 2 audit evidence**: IAM reports, logging configs, incident response plans.


## 3. Security Automation with IaC

Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to enforce security and compliance at scale.

### Tools & Practices:
- **Terraform**, **CloudFormation** – Define infrastructure declaratively.
- Codify guardrails:
  - Deny public S3 access.
  - Enforce MFA for IAM users.
- Align with **CIS Benchmarks** and **NIST CSF**.


## 4. Continuous Compliance & Misconfiguration Scanning

Automate detection of policy violations and misconfigurations.

### Tools:
- **Terraform**, **AWS Config**
- **Checkov**, **tfsec**, **OpenSCAP**

### Practice:
- Scan Terraform plans for misconfigs using:
  - `checkov`
  - `tfsec`

## 5. Security Monitoring & Incident Response

Continuous monitoring and rapid response are crucial compliance components.

### Key Elements:
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs in SIEM solutions (CloudWatch Logs, Splunk, ELK)
- **Alerting**: Configure actionable alerts based on security events
- **Automation**: Use AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for automated remediation
- **Incident Response Plan**: Document procedures aligned with NIST 800-61

### Compliance Mapping:
- NIST: IR-4 (Incident Handling), AU-6 (Audit Review)
- SOC 2: CC7.3, CC7.4 (Monitoring and Response)


## 6. Zero Trust Architecture

Modern compliance frameworks increasingly require zero trust principles.

### Implementation:
- **Identity-based Access**: Verify identity for all resource access
- **Least Privilege**: Limit permissions to minimum required
- **Microsegmentation**: Network segmentation at granular level
- **Continuous Verification**: Real-time assessment of trust

### AWS Implementation:
- IAM Roles with Session Tags
- AWS Network Firewall with stateful inspection
- VPC Endpoints for service isolation
- GuardDuty for continuous threat detection


## 7. Practical Implementation Examples

### AWS Config Conformance Pack Example:
```yaml
Resources:
  S3BucketPublicReadProhibited:
    Type: AWS::Config::ConfigRule
    Properties:
      ConfigRuleName: s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited
      Source:
        Owner: AWS
        SourceIdentifier: S3_BUCKET_PUBLIC_READ_PROHIBITED
      Scope:
        ComplianceResourceTypes:
          - AWS::S3::Bucket
```

### Terraform Security Guardrails:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  
  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```


## 8. Advanced Security Automation

### Checkov Examples:
Scan infrastructure code for security issues:
```bash
# Basic scan
checkov -d /path/to/terraform/files

# Skip specific checks
checkov -d . --skip-check CKV_AWS_18,CKV_AWS_21

# Output as JSON for CI/CD integration
checkov -d . --output json
```

### tfsec Usage:
```bash
# Scan Terraform code
tfsec .

# Custom checks
tfsec --custom-check-dir ./custom-checks

# Generate findings in SARIF format
tfsec --format sarif
```

## 9. Encryption Best Practices

Encryption is fundamental to compliance across all frameworks.

### Data at Rest:
- **S3**: Server-side encryption with KMS (SSE-KMS)
- **EBS**: Volume encryption with customer-managed keys
- **RDS**: Database encryption with automatic key rotation
- **DynamoDB**: Table encryption with AWS owned or customer-managed keys

### Data in Transit:
- **TLS 1.3**: For all API communications
- **VPN/Direct Connect**: For secure connectivity to cloud resources
- **API Gateway**: With custom domain and TLS certificate

### Key Management:
- **AWS KMS**: Centralized key management with detailed audit logs
- **Automated Rotation**: Schedule key rotation every 90 days
- **Access Controls**: Implement least privilege for key usage
