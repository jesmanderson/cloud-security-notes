# VoIP Engineering Meets Cloud Security & GRC

Welcome, engineers! If you're transitioning from VoIP into the world of Cloud Security and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance), this guide will help you connect the dots between your current skills and the broader security landscape.

---

## Identity & Access Management (IAM)

**VoIP Tasks:**
- Managing CUCM user roles and device access
- Using secure credential vaults (e.g., BeyondTrust)

**Cloud Security Alignment:**
- Maps directly to cloud IAM (Azure AD, AWS IAM)
- Role-based access control and least privilege principles

---

## Network Security & Segmentation

**VoIP Tasks:**
- Configuring VLANs, ACLs, SBC firewall rules
- Lab setups with pfSense and secure routing

**Cloud Security Alignment:**
- Similar to cloud VPCs, NSGs (Azure), and security groups (AWS)
- Supports Zero Trust architectures

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

**VoIP Tasks:**
- Monitoring call flows, registration status, and DSP usage

**Cloud Security Alignment:**
- Cloud tools like Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, and SIEMs (Splunk)
- Enables proactive threat detection and compliance tracking

---

## Incident Response & Root Cause Analysis

**VoIP Tasks:**
- Troubleshooting IVR DTMF issues, codec mismatches, registration failures

**Cloud Security Alignment:**
- Critical for cloud incident response and forensic analysis
- Skills transfer to log analysis and vulnerability remediation

---

## Change Management

**VoIP Tasks:**
- SCCP config changes, dial-peer updates, CAB meetings

**Cloud Security Alignment:**
- Prevents misconfigurations in cloud environments
- Supports secure deployment pipelines and rollback strategies

---

## Compliance & Audit Readiness

**VoIP Tasks:**
- Documenting changes, tracking issues, aligning with ITIL

**Cloud Security Alignment:**
- Supports frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, NIST
- Builds audit trails and policy enforcement

---

## Encryption & Secure Communications

**VoIP Tasks:**
- TLS for SIP trunks, SRTP for media streams

**Cloud Security Alignment:**
- Encryption in transit and at rest is foundational
- Applies to cloud storage, APIs, and communications

---

## Automation & Scripting

**VoIP Tasks:**
- PowerShell scripts, FreeFTPd, lab automation

**Cloud Security Alignment:**
- Essential for infrastructure as code (IaC), policy automation, and threat response

## Final Thoughts

Your VoIP experience gives you a strong foundation in operational security, troubleshooting, and change control, all of which are critical in cloud security and GRC roles. Keep documenting, automating, and aligning with best practices, and you'll thrive in the cloud!
